To make this persistent, create a file at /etc/chromium-browser/customizations/92-vaapi-hardware-decoding with the following contents:\n","\n","CHROMIUM_FLAGS=\"${CHROMIUM_FLAGS} --enable-features=VaapiVideoDecoder\"\n","\n","See also https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Chromium#Hardware_video_acceleration for more information on VAAPI video decoding support.\n","\n","=== Widevine Support ===\n","\n","The packages in this PPA have support for Widevine inside Chromium enabled. However, you still need to copy some files from Chrome into Chromium for you to use Netflix (or other websites using Encrypted Media Extensions) in Chromium.\n","\n","1. Download and install Chrome (or extract the necessary files, if you know how to do that).\n","2. From the Chrome installation directory (probably /opt/google/chome or something similar), copy libwidevinecdm.so into ~/.config/chromium.\n","3. Restart Chromium.\n","\n","=== Preventing falling back to the standard version of Chromium ===\n","\n","Sometimes, this PPA doesn't get updated within a few days of a release, and in some cases, the version of Chromium in the standard Ubuntu repos may be newer than the version provided by the PPA. If you want to prevent apt from updating to the version in the standard Ubuntu repos, add the following three lines into /etc/apt/preferences.d/chromium:\n","\n","Package: *\n","Pin: release o=LP-PPA-saiarcot895-chromium-beta\n","Pin-Priority: 700\n","\n","=== Help ===\n","\n","If you need help with installing Chromium or notice stuff not working that should normally work, click on my name below in the \"Adding this PPA to your system\" section.\n","\n","=== Packaging ===\n","\n","Packaging for this PPA is at https://github.com/saiarcot895/chromium-ubuntu-build.
